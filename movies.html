            Though flawed, <i>Lost in Translation’s</i> melancholy yet hopeful
            mood created an atmosphere in which I became completely engrossed.
            The movie focuses on a washed out actor and his trip to Japan,
            following his encounters with the culture and the people of such a
            drastically different culture. Bill Murray portrays the absolute
            confusion of a man in unfamiliar lands with expressive silence. The
            culture he observes is depicted almost as if he is on an alien
            planet. At the start, the way in which his character viewed the
            people and life of Tokyo almost seemed disdainful, leading me to
            believe there were subtle racist undertones to the film. However, as
            the characters became more fleshed out it was easy to see that
            racism was not the intent of the film. Scarlett Johansson did a
            wonderful job of playing a woman who feels lost in life. Her subdued
            desperation made me emphasize highly with her character. Though each
            actor individually did fantastic, the real focus of the movie was
            the connection between the two main characters. Where some may see a
            romance, I see a story of a friendship, deeply connected by their
            loneliness. The relate to each other, almost seeming like they are
            the only two sane people in the world. Everyone else in the movie is
            unable to truly connect with either of them- For Murray’s character
            it’s the language and culture barrier, with Johansson’s being the
            differing goals of her and her husband. The age gap may appear
            strange, especially since Johansson was actually 17 when the movie
            was filmed, but I think the directors and writers meant for them to
            be viewed as having an ultimately platonic friendship. Another
            thing- there wasn't really a story throughout the entire movie, but
            that may have been the point. To be completely honest, it had a bit
            too little of a plot for me, and everything that the characters did
            seemed fruitless. Though sweet, the ending left me with a yearning
            for more, wishing the characters could continue their carefree lives
            forever.
            <i>Lost in Translation</i>
            offers a low key and somber experience, sure to leave one with a
            sense of wistful contemplation.

          <h2>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker(2019)</h2>

            I'm a major Star Wars nerd. I've also never been the gatekeeping
            type of person that hates on the sequels. In fact, The Force Awakens
            was the movie that got me into the series in the first place! So I
            went into this movie with a totally optimistic and excited mindset.
            It started out rough. Everything felt a bit rushed, and it was a bit
            difficult to tell what exactly was going on. Honestly, in the first
            10 minutes, I kept thinking "Oh, no. Am I going to hate this movie?"
            However, as it progressed, the pacing issues got ironed out. It
            ended up being an extremely exhilarating experience. Though it got
            rid of many of the aspects that <i>The Last Jedi</i> emphasized, it
            managed to hold on to the few truly meaningful ones. For example,
            Rey and Kylo’s connection was explored further and with more depth,
            leading to their relationship easily becoming my favorite part of
            the trilogy. Rey and Ben Solo were basically all of the high points
            of the movie. Their characters go through drastic development, but
            not in a way that seems rushed or unnatural. Rey’s seeming descent
            into darkness was handled with grace, and Daisy Ridley did a
            fantastic job depicting her agonizing internal conflict. Adam Driver
            was phenomenal, especially during touching moments such as his
            reconnection with his mother. A common complaint about the previous
            movie was it’s lack of lightsaber fights. Well,
            <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> delivers. The battle between Rey and
            Kylo was emotional, intense, and my now favorite lightsaber duel of
            the entire saga. Not to mention the set design was beautifully
            dangerous, adding even more intensity to the fight. I was sitting on
            the edge of my seat the entire time, and I’m pretty sure I let out
            an audible gasp at several points during it. As for the ending, I’m
            quite satisfied. I believe most if not all of the characters had a
            justified exit. All in all, <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> wrapped up
            the saga,especially the trilogy, in an emotional, intense, and
            satisfying manner. <br /><br />Meg's Rating: 8.5/10<br /><br />
