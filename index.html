          <h2>Hello, and Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Meglan, and welcome to my review site. I built this site for
            the purpose of gaining experience in HTML and CSS. I was thinking of
            developing a project that I would be able to put on my resume and
            figured, "Hey, I like movies, TV, and sharing my opinions- why don't
            I make a site so I can share my thoughts with the world." Warning
            you ahead of time- I'm not much of a writer, and I can be pretty
            terrible at organizing my thoughts. These are mainly just me
            rambling about my experiences. Don't take it too seriously!

            Hi! I'm Meglan. Star Wars, comic book, film, video game, and art
            nerd. I watch a lot of TV and movies, so here's my thoughts on a few
            of them. Enjoy!
